## Overview 🚀

Advent of Code is an annual coding event with daily programming challenges throughout December. This repository houses my JavaScript solutions to these challenges. Each day has its own solution file(s) along with any necessary input files.

## Getting Started 🛠️

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manullbrand/advent-of-code-year.git
```

2. Navigate to the day you're interested in:

```bash
cd advent-of-code-year/day01
```

3. Run the solution for Part X:

```bash
node partX.js
```

## Usage ⚙️

Each day's solution is a JavaScript file (e.g., part1.js, part2.js). Execute it using Node.js.
Input data for each day is usually provided in the input.txt file.

## Folder Structure 📂

The folder structure for each day might look like this:

```lua
day01/
|-- instructionsX.txt
|-- partX.js
|-- part2.js
|-- README.md

```

- instructionsX.txt: Input data for the day's challenge. Change the X to get the matching instruction.
- partX.js: JavaScript file containing the solution for Part X. Change the X to get the matching part of the challenge your are looking for.
- README.md: Documentation for the day's challenge, including instructions and any additional notes.
